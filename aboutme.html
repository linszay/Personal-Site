            <h1>A little about me</h1>
            <p>
                Hello there! I'm Lindsey Lancaster, a dedicated professional
                 with a diverse background and a passion for continuous learning.
                  Currently, I'm on the path to becoming a Front-End Developer,
                   with a strong commitment to advancing my skills.
            </p>
            <p>
                One of my standout qualities is attention to detail,
                a trait that ensures precision and accuracy in everything 
                I take on. Alongside that, I take pride in my excellent communication,
                 strong interpersonal skills, and a knack for effective teamwork, 
                 which has allowed me to build positive relationships with colleagues, 
                 clients, and customers.
            </p>
            <p>
                While I currently hold an associate's degree, my
                 enthusiasm for growth has led me to the exciting 
                 world of Front-End Development. I'm actively pursuing 
                 further education in this field, eager to enhance my 
                 technical expertise and contribute to the dynamic realm
                  of web development.
            </p>
            <span>
                I am currently going to school to become a Front-End Developer!
                I have spent time working as a Chiropractic Assistant, Bank Teller, and most recently,
                I worked as an Electronic Data Technician. I enjoyed spending time in different
                fields, and learning a lot along the way. My journey has led me to where
                I am now, and I'm thankful for that. I look forward to connecting with you,
                and thank you for viewing my page! :)
