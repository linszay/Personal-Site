        <span>
            I am currently going to school to become a Front-End Developer!
            I have spent time working as a Chiropractic Assistant, Bank Teller, and most recently,
            I worked as an Electronic Data Technician. I have spent time in different
            fields, and learned a lot along the way. My journey has led me to where
            I am now, and I'm thankful for that. I look forward to connecting with you,
            and thank you for viewing my page! :)
